/**
 * Base class for all selectors.
 *
 * A selector is a multiplexor for I/O events associated to a Conduit.
 * All selectors must implement this interface.
 *
 * A selector needs to be initialized by calling the open() method to pass
 * it the initial amount of conduits that it will handle and the maximum
 * amount of events that will be returned per call to select(). In both cases,
 * these values are only hints and may not even be used by the specific
 * ISelector implementation you choose to use, so you cannot make any
 * assumptions regarding what results from the call to select() (i.e. you
 * may receive more or less events per call to select() than what was passed
 * in the 'maxEvents' argument. The amount of conduits that the selector can
 * manage will be incremented dynamically if necessary.
 *
 * To add or modify conduit registrations in the selector, use the register()
 * method.  To remove conduit registrations from the selector, use the
 * unregister() method.
 *
 * To wait for events from the conduits you need to call any of the select()
 * methods. The selector cannot be modified from another thread while
 * blocking on a call to these methods.
 *
 * Once the selector is no longer used you must call the close() method so
 * that the selector can free any resources it may have allocated in the call
 * to open().
 *
 * See_Also: ISelector

 * // will receive 2 events per invocation to the select() method.
 * selector.open(2, 2);
 *
 * selector.register(conduit, Event.Read, object1);
 * selector.register(conduit, Event.Write, object2);
