/** Generate a UUID according to version 3 of RFC 4122.
  *
  * These UUIDs are generated in a consistent, repeatable fashion. If you
  * generate a version 3 UUID once, it will be the same as the next time you
  * generate it.
  *
  * To create a version 3 UUID, you need a namespace UUID, generated in some
  * reasonable fashion. This is hashed with a name that you provide to generate
  * the UUID. So while you can easily map names to UUIDs, the reverse mapping
  * will require a lookup of some sort.
  *
  * This module publicly imports Uuid, so you don't have to import both if you
  * are generating version 3 UUIDs. Also, this module is just provided for
  * convenience -- you can use the method Uuid.byName if you already have an
  * appropriate digest.
  *
  * Version 3 UUIDs use MD5 as the hash function. You may prefer to use version
  * 5 UUIDs instead, which use SHA-1.
  *
  * To use this module:
  * ---
  * import tango.util.uuid.NamespaceGenV3;
  * auto dnsNamespace = Uuid.parse("6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8");
  * auto uuid = newUuid(namespace, "rainbow.flotilla.example.org");
  * ---
