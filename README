===] Tango D2 Port [=====================================================================================================

This is a half-hearted effort to port Tango (http://www.dsource.org/projects/tango/) to the D2 programming language. I am doing this quickly, and in a haphazard fashion. I primarily care that it compiles, and passes the unittests (or my own quick tests). I am sure the parts I ported don't work 100%.

This port roughly follows the guidelines outlined in the 'porting_guidelines' file. If you want to help out, please follow that procedure.

I see this as a rough first pass at porting this library... making it more D2 like will be the second pass.

What works so far:

See 'ported_modules' file. More modules may work, but only the listed ones pass the import + unittest test.

Some notables:

tango.io.Stdout and the imported modules (notably tango.io.Console, tango.text.convert.Layout and tango.core.Thread (maybe))
tango.text.xml.Document and the imported modules
tango.io.device.File
tango.core.Array
tango.core.Traits
tango.math

What will work next:

Who knows... I'm porting stuff rather randomly.

What won't work for awhile:

Anything that's hard to port... like intrinsics/anything that's Tango's runtime specific

How to use it:

Just manually import/compile modules you want. Tools like xfbuild (https://bitbucket.org/h3r3tic/xfbuild/wiki/Home) are of great help here. Building the whole library won't be supported for awhile.

You can message me on github, or find me on IRC on #d and #d.tango @ irc.freenode.net




===] Building the Libary [==================================================================================================

There is a Makefile for GNU/Linux to build the libary

	make -f linux.mak

You can also generate the docs. They'll be puttet to doc/html

	make doc -f linux.mak

If you need to rebuild the libary, you can tidy up your folder by

	make clean -f linux.mak

And of course you can install the libary to /usr/lib/libtango2.a

	make install -f linux.mak


===] Setting up your Environment [===========================================================================================

If you want to build your applications with tango, you need to take care to link against the tango libary. You can tell dmd to automatically link to tangolib by modifing
/etc/dmd.conf. Basically you need to add 

	* -I/usr/include/d/dmd/phobos
