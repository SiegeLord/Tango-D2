===] Tango D2 Port [================================================================================================

This is a half-hearted effort to port Tango (http://www.dsource.org/projects/tango/) to the D2 programming language. I am doing this quickly, and in a haphazard fashion. I primarily care that it compiles, and passes the unittests (or my own quick tests). I am sure the parts I ported don't work 100%.

This port roughly follows the guidelines outlined in the 'porting_guidelines' file. If you want to help out, please follow that procedure.

I see this as a rough first pass at porting this library... making it more D2 like will be the second pass.

What works so far:

See 'ported_modules' file. More modules may work, but only the listed ones pass the import + unittest test.

Some notables:

tango.io.Stdout and the imported modules (notably tango.io.Console, tango.text.convert.Layout and tango.core.Thread (maybe))
tango.text.xml.Document and the imported modules
tango.io.device.File
tango.core.Array
tango.core.Traits
tango.math

What will work next:

Who knows... I'm porting stuff rather randomly.

What won't work for awhile:

Anything that's hard to port... like intrinsics/anything that's Tango's runtime specific

How to use it:

Just manually import/compile modules you want. Tools like xfbuild (https://bitbucket.org/h3r3tic/xfbuild/wiki/Home) are of great help here. Building the whole library won't be supported for awhile.

You can message me on github, or find me on IRC on #d and #d.tango @ irc.freenode.net

===] Building the Libary [=============================================================================================
You can just checkout the libary and start building it. There is a Makefile for GNU/Linux to build the libary. I assume that you're using dmd to compile it! Just type the following commands to your console.

	* cd /usr/include/d/dmd
	* git clone git://github.com/mtachrono/tango.git tango
	* cd tango
	* make -f posix.mak
	* make install -f posix.mak
	
===] Building additional parts [=======================================================================================

You can also generate the docs. They'll be puttet to doc/html

	make doc -f posix.mak

If you need to rebuild the libary, you can tidy up your folder by

	make clean -f posix.mak

And of course you can install the libary to /usr/lib/libtango2.a

	make install -f posix.mak


===] Setting up your Environment [======================================================================================

If you want to build your applications with tango, you need to take care to link against the tango libary. You can tell dmd to automatically link to tangolib by modifing /etc/dmd.conf. Basically you need to add the following line.

-I/usr/include/d/dmd/tango
	
Here is my complete /etc/dmd.conf

[Environment]
DFLAGS= -I/usr/include/d/dmd/phobos -I/usr/include/d/dmd/tango -I/usr/include/d/dmd/druntime/import -L-L/usr/lib32 -L-L/usr/lib64 -L--no-warn-search-mismatch -L--export-dynamic -L-lrt
